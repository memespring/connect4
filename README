A class for generating a matrix of search counts for a series of search terms. 
Useful when trying to speculatively track down connections between companies and people.

Currently only supports google. 

Example usage:

1) Return a table as a string:

connect4 = Connect4(['Badger', 'Set', 'Tennis'])        
connect4.to_string()

         badger   set         tennis   
-------------------------------------------
badger  | -       | 255000    | 36800     | 
set     | 256000  | -         | 26600000  | 
tennis  | 37100   | 26600000  | -         |


2) Return the columns, rows and data:

connect4 = Connect4(['Badger', 'Set', 'Tennis'])        
columns = connect4.get_column_names()
rows = connect4.get_row_names()
data = connect4.get_matrix()

3) Return a list of available search terms (currently only google):

connect4 = Connect4()                
connect4.list_search_types()
